As a result, the disjunctive premise is false, or at least probably false.2011, Tomasz A. Gorarzd, Jacek Krzaczkowski, The Complexity of Problems Connected with Two-Element Algebras, Pawe M. Idziak, Andrzej Wronski, Reports on Mathematical Logic: No. 46, page 92,One can ask if for any algebra the considered problem is always in P or NP-complete (P or coNP-complete)? For example, the problem of the satisfiability of a system of polynomial equations over a group G is in P if G is abelian and NP-complete otherwise ([7, 13]).One of the most widely known subclasses of NP which exhibits such a dichotomy, is the class of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) on the set {0,1}, see [16]. Recently Bulatov proved the dichotomy for CSP on a three-element set [3].(biology, taxonomy) The division of a genus into two species; a division into two subordinate parts.(astronomy) A phase of the moon when it appears half lit and half dark, as at the quadratures.1854,  Edward Greswell,  Origines Kalendari Italic: Tables of the Roman Calendar[3], volume 1, page 261:The Ides of Januarius indeed, the preceding month, must have fallen on March 1 at midnight, two days before the first dichotomy of the mean new moon of that month, March 3 at midnight.(biology) Division and subdivision; bifurcation, as of a stem of a plant or a vein of the body into two parts as it proceeds from its origin; often successive.1969, J.

In A v.
