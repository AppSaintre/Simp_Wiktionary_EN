Where [George] Orwells society was governed by the stick, we are offered the carrot. The truncation of the language on Airstrip One was a logical response to the harsh social engineering that engendered it. The soothing, delusory world of equality, of much-touted democracy, has created a newspeak all its own. Rather than shorten the language it is infinitely broadened; instead of curt monosyllables, there are mellifluous, calming phrases, designed to allay suspicions, modify facts and divert ones attention from difficulties.1995,  Edward Moejko,  Between Symbolist Decline and the Rise of Newspeak: Mapping the Dynamics of the Russian Literary Avant-Garde, in Christian Berg, Frank Durieux, and Geert Lernout, editors, The Turn of the Century: Modernism and Modernity in Literature and the Arts/Le tournant du sicle&#160;: Le modernisme et la modernit dans la littrature et les arts (European Cultures; 3), Berlin; New York, N.Y.: Walter de Gruyter, ISBN, page 327:[T]he last stage in the evolution of the Russian literary avant-garde and its final demise was marked by its sharp and growing conflict with the rise of newspeak. The concept of newspeak has been with us now for quite some time. However, it only recently began to be treated as an exponent of a certain cultural vision advanced by sheer and impudent political power. At the same time, it is more than that.
