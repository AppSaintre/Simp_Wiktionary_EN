The killer, or virama, participates in some common constructions that would be clumsy to handle the way they would be in the other Indic scripts, so the control function of the virama is separated from the diacritic function of the killer. The virama, 0F4D is used to form conjunct consonants, while the killer, 0F52, is a simple diacritic and has no effect on character shaping. The killer is also combined with the VOWEL SIGN O (0F4B) to form the low level tone vowel o. When used this way, this symbol is known as hyei hto, or thrust forward.  http://unicode.org/reports/tr1.htmlFor example, although the vowel killer diacritic may be called a pulli in Tamil, it is still referred to by the Unicode character names as a virama.  http://www.w3.org/2002/Talks/09-ri-indic/indic-paper.htmlThai words that have been borrowed from Sanskrit, Pali and English usually try to retain as much of the original spelling as possible; as this will often produce pronunciations that are impossible or misleading, a killer symbol is placed above the redundant consonant to indicate that it may be ignored  Thai: An Essential Grammar By David SmythSometimes the killer sign, called kaaran in Thai, cancels out not only the consonant above which it appears, but also the one immediately preceding it.
