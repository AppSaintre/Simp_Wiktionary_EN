For instance, some people are just not very nice (on the bad side), and others are really bad - rapists, murderers, etc. (more deeply on the bad side). Their consciousness is a result of using their free will over time.

This expediating, hambling, or lawing, as it was indifferently termed, was intended to maim the dog as to reduce to a minimum the chances of his chasing and seizing the deer, and the law enforced its being done after the following manner: Three claws of the fore foot shall be cut off by the skin, by setting one of his fore feet upon a piece of wood 8 inches thick and 1 foot square, and with a mallet, setting a chisel of 2 inches broad upon the three claws of his fore feet, and at one blow cutting them clean off.

Analysis and Criticism.), paragraph 7, pages 757758:The anhypostasia, impersonality, or, to speak more accurately, the enhypostasia, of the human nature of Christ. This is a difficult point, but a necessary link in the orthodox doctrine of the one God-Man; for otherwise we must have two persons in Christ, and, after the incarnation, a fourth person, and that a human, in the divine Trinity. The impersonality of Christ\\'s human nature, however, is not to be taken as absolute, but relative, as the following considerations will show. [] The divine nature is therefore the root and basis of the personality of Christ. [] And the human nature of Christ had no independent personality of its own, besides the divine; it had no existence at all before the incarnation, but began with this act, and was so incorporated with the pre-existent Logos-personality as to find in this alone its own full self-consciousness, and to be permeated and controlled by it in every stage of its development.1872,  John M\\'Clintock [i.e., John McClintock]; James Strong,  John of Damascus, in  Cyclopdia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, volume IV (H, I, J), New York, N.Y.: Harper &amp; Brothers, publishers, Franklin Square, OCLC 22985522, pages 964965:The doctrine of the person of Christ is argued with greatest fullness, and he [John of Damascus] evinces no little ingenuity and dialectic skill in treating of the personal unity in Christ\\'s twofold nature (which he conceived as enhypostasis, not anhypostasis, of the human nature in the Logos), [] 1954 September,  T[homas] F[orsyth] Torrance,  The Atonement and the Oneness of the Church, in  Scottish Journal of Theology, volume 7, number 3, Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, DOI:10.1017/S0036930600001502, ISSN 0036-9306, OCLC 1004668329, page 249; quoted in  Thomas F. Torrance,  The Place of Christology in Biblical and Dogmatic Theology, in  Theology in Reconstruction, Eugene, Or.: Wipf and Stock, 19 December 1996, ISBN, footnote 1, page 131:By anhypostasia classical Christology asserted that in the assumptio carnis the human nature of Christ had no independent per se subsistence apart from the event of the incarnation, apart from the hypostatic union. By enhypostasia, however, it asserted that in the assumptio carnis the human nature of Christ was given a real and concrete subsistence within the hypostatic unionit was enhypostatic in the Word. Anhypostasia and enhypostasia are inseparable. In the incarnation the eternal Son assumed human nature into oneness with Himself, but in that assumption Jesus Christ is not only real man but a man.1992,  Wiel Logister,  In the Name of Jesus Christ: Christology and the Interreligious Dialogue, in Catherine Cornille and Valeer Neckebrouck, editors, A Universal Faith?: Peoples, Cultures, Religions, and the Christ [...] Essays in Honor of Prof. Dr. Frank De Graeve (Louvain Theological &amp; Pastoral Monographs; 9), Louvain: Peeters Press; [Grand Rapids, Mich.]: W[illiam] B. Eerdmans, ISBN, pages 172173:When, for instance, theology speaks of Jesus\\' anhypostasis and his enhypostasis, these ontological terms must be understood in the light of the concrete ways in which Jesus acted and spoke in the name of God, the ways in which he maintained the distinctions between himself and God through his self-abnegation, and how he left others with no impression of pedantry or dogmatism.1998,  John Macquarrie,  Two Traditional Ideas Evaluated, in  Christology Revisited, London: SCM Press, published 2003, ISBN, page 45:Enhypostasia, a doctrine which arose later as a modification of anhypostasia, concedes that Jesus Christ did indeed have a human hypostasis, but it was taken up and included in the hypostasis of the Logos.2006,  Simon Chan,  Encountering the Triune God: Spirituality since the Azusa Street Revival, in Harold D.

The term AB is interpreted as the union of the properties in the intent of A and the intent of B and A+B is interpreted as the intersection of the properties in A and B.

[] [A]ct and entelechy bespeak something fulfilled, actualized perfection, or the actualized. The soul, hence, insofar as it is essence or form of the body, is the act and entelechy of the body; and in general all forms of sensible substances are act and entelechy.

Lindsay,  Psychotic Entelechy: The Dangers of Spiritual Gifts Theology, Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, ISBN, page 123:Simply put, entelechy is any process that has a beginning, middle, and end. The end or goal is the telos; it shows up as the second syllable of the word en-TEL-echy. A simple natural entelechy is the corn entelechy. A kernel of corn when planted begins an entelechy. That is, a process of growth begins as the kernel/seed sprouts roots, then a blade. The growth process continues until it reaches its telos. Its telos is the completion of the process and the resulting production of brand new kernels that look very much like the kernel that began this process. Once that telos or goal has been reached, we say that the process is complete or perfect or teleios. But then what happens? A new entelechy begins. Each of those kernels that were produced in the previous entelechy begins to sprout and produces its own entelechy. In other words, entelechies are often cyclical.2007,  Leonieke Vermeer,  \\'The Journey to the Summits of Perfection\\': Moral Evolution as a Utopian Vista in the Dutch Fin de Sicle, in Mary G.

A measure of the amount of energy in a physical system that cannot be used to do work.The thermodynamic free energy is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform; it is the internal energy of a system minus the amount of energy that cannot be used to perform work. That unusable energy is given by the entropy of a system multiplied by the temperature of the system.[1] (Note that, for both Gibbs and Helmholtz free energies, temperature is assumed to be fixed, so entropy is effectively directly proportional to useless energy.)A measure of the disorder present in a system.Ludwig Boltzmann defined entropy as being directly proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates yielding an equivalent thermodynamic macrostate (with the eponymous constant of proportionality). Assuming (by the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics), that all microstates are equally probable, this means, on the one hand, that macrostates with higher entropy are more probable, and on the other hand, that for such macrostates, the quantity of information required to describe a particular one of its microstates will be higher. That is, the Shannon entropy of a macrostate would be directly proportional to the logarithm of the number of equivalent microstates (making it up). In other words, thermodynamic and informational entropies are rather compatible, which shouldn\\'t be surprising since Claude Shannon derived the notation \\'H\\' for information entropy from Boltzmann\\'s H-theorem.The capacity factor for thermal energy that is hidden with respect to temperature [2].The dispersal of energy; how much energy is spread out in a process, or how widely spread out it becomes, at a specific temperature.
