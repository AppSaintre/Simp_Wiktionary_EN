Any digestable dose of Cannabin, being the full phytopharmaceutical extract of the hemp flower in food quality, has thus been proven non-toxic and non-poisonous[1] to humans. Cannabin can show a remarkably wide range of effects in the human body[2], of which none is guaranteed. But the \"narcotic effects of hashish\" are a mere footnote therein and are most valid for enourmous doses.

A word is taken of two or more syllables, each forming a distinct word; each of these is described in verse or prose, as aptly and enigmatically as possible; and the same process is applied to the whole word. The neater and briefer the descriptive parts of the problem, the better the charade will be. In selecting words for charades, special attention should be paid to the absolute quality of the syllables composing them, inaccuracy in trifles of this sort depriving them of what little claim to merit they may possess. The brilliant rhythmic trifles of W. Mackworth Praed are well known. Of representative prose charades, the following specimens are perhaps as good as could be selected:My first, with the most rooted antipathy to a Frenchman, prides himself, whenever they meet, upon sticking close to his jacket; my second has many virtues, nor is its least that it gives its name to my first; my whole may I never catch!
