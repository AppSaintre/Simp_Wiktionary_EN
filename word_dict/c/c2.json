The United Kingdom[1], number 4241/12, marginal 48:The Court has previously considered a number of earlier cases concerning funding for care and medical treatment as falling within the sphere of possible positive obligations because the applicants complained in substance not of action but of a lack of action by the respondent States (see, for example, Sentges v. the Netherlands and Pentiacova v. Moldova, both cited above). Those cases concerned the refusal by the State to provide funding for medical equipment and/or treatment. In the present case, however, the local authority had initially provided the applicant with a night-time carer, albeit, in the description of the Supreme Court, as a concession granted on a temporary basis (see paragraph 11 above). The applicant is therefore complaining not of a lack of action but rather of the decision of the local authority to reduce the care package that it had hitherto been making available to her. As such, a more appropriate comparator would be the case of Watts v. The United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53586/09 of 4 May 2010, in which the Court was content to proceed on the basis that a decision to close the care home where the elderly applicant was resident and to transfer her to another home constituted an interference with her rights under Article 8.2017 November 9,  United States District Court for the District of Connecticut,  Roxanne Khazarian vs. Gerald Metals, LLC, Metals Trading Corp., Gerald Holdings, LLC, Craig Dean, and Dan Gamez[2], number No. 3:16-cv-01762(VAB):Roxanne Khazarian (Plaintiff) moved to compel discovery from Gerald Metals, LLC and Metals Trading Corp (Defendants), seeking the personnel file of Gary Lerner, an employee of Defendants.

More efficient nonparametric methods that work even in the presence of long-range correlations are based on the property that the entropy of a sequence is a lower bound to any lossless compressed version of it [15]. Thus, in principle, it is possible to estimate the entropy of a sequence by finding its length after being compressed by an optimal algorithm.

Among the first linguists to base a theory of meaning on the notion of meaning by collocation is J.R. Firth (1957) who is commonly credited with systematically introducing the concept of collocation into linguistic theory.2006, Tony McEnery, Richard Xiao, Yukio Tono, Corpus-Based Language Studies: An Advanced Resource Book, Taylor &amp; Francis:[p&#160;56] The term collocation refers to the characteristic co-occurrence patterns of words, i.e., which words typically co-occur in corpus data (see Units A10.2 and C1). Collocates can be lexical words or grammatical words. Collocations are identified using a statistical approach. Three statistical formulae are most commonly used in corpus linguistics to identify significant collocations: the M1 (mutual information), t and z scores.[p&#160;159] In lexical studies collocation and semantic prosody/preference can only be quantified reliably on the basis of corpus data.(mathematics) A method of determining coefficients in an expansion                     y        (        x        )        =                  y                      0                          (        x        )        +                  &#x2211;                      l            =            0                                q                                    &#x03B1;                      l                                    y                      l                          (        x        )              {\\\\displaystyle y(x)=y_{0}(x)+\\\\sum _{l=0}^{q}\\\\alpha _{l}y_{l}(x)}   so as to nullify the values of an ordinary differential equation                     L        [        y        (        x        )        ]        =        0              {\\\\displaystyle L[y(x)]=0}   at prescribed points.(computing) A service allowing multiple customers to locate network, server, and storage gear, connect them to a variety of telecommunications and network service providers, with a minimum of cost and complexity.2011, \"Tyler Durden\", Zero Hedge, Watch Bernanke\\'s Q&amp;A With FOMC Approved Sycophants Live Here:As usual, nothing of significance will be asked, and most certainly, answered, but do expect the dollar (and, inversely, ES) to go up, then down, then up, and so forth as random vacuum tubes blow in NYSE\\'s ultramodern Mahwah collocation facility.", "cleverness": " (countable and uncountable, plural clevernesses)The property of being clever.Something clever, or done cleverly.", "clinked": "simple past tense and past participle of clink", "cohomology": " (countable and uncountable, plural cohomologies)(mathematics) A method of contravariantly associating a family of invariant quotient groups to each algebraic or geometric object of a category, including categories of geometric and algebraic objects.(mathematics) A system of quotient groups associated to a topological space.", "conceptual": " (comparative more conceptual, superlative most conceptual)Of, or relating to concepts or mental conception; existing in the imagination.We defined a conceptual model before designing the real thing.1992, Rudolf M.

The cleavage of the particles themselves and its attitude with reference to the plane of the greatest and mean dimensional axes help to determine the perfection of rock cleavage. The more nearly parallel to the greater dimensions of the particle, and the better the mineral cleavage, the better the rock cleavage produced.1990,  N[eville] J. Price; J[ohn] W. Cosgrove,  Rock Cleavage and Other Tectonic Fabrics, in  Analysis of Geological Structures, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN, page 434:It will become apparent from the following discussion that some of the various structures which are grouped together as cleavage may correspond to a schistosity and/or foliation. Accordingly, Wilson defines rock cleavage (and schistosity) as a planar structure, usually distinct from stratification, which permits rocks to be fractured or cleaved into thin slices. Dennis (1977) defines cleavage as a set of closely spaced secondary, planar, parallel fabric elements that impart mechanical anisotropy to a rock without apparent loss of cohesion. This latter definition appears more precise; however, as we shall see, it presents many difficulties in dealing with those forms of cleavage which are mainly defined by foliation or by fractures.The hollow or separation between a woman\\'s breasts, especially as revealed by a low neckline.
