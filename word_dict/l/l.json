But there are more substantial reasons for believing that the lateen came from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean. The earliest evidence of the existence of lateens in the Mediterranean is in Greek Byzantine manuscripts of the late ninth century, which show drawings of lateens (Plates 5 and 6).", "lgth": "Abbreviation of length.", "libelled": "(Britain) simple past tense and past participle of libel", "losable": " (not comparable)that can be lost", "leafs": "(nonstandard) plural of leafThird-person singular simple present indicative form of leaf", "laggings": "plural of lagging", "lexiphanes": "plural of lexiphane", "longshot": " (plural longshots)Alternative spelling of long shot.", "latticework": " (countable and uncountable, plural latticeworks)A lattice or latticelike structure; interlacing laths or strips.", "loblolly": " (countable and uncountable, plural loblollies)(dialect, nautical) Gruel.(US, southern) A mudhole.1931, William Faulkner, Sanctuary, Vintage 1993, p. 122:he and Narcissa paddled and splashed with tucked-up garments and muddy bottoms, after the crudest of whittled boats, or made loblollies by treading and treading in one spot with the intense oblivion of alchemists.(now mostly dialect) A bumpkin or lout.1675, Lucian (trans.
