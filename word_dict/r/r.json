Szasz, M.D.,  chapter 7, in  The Myth of Mental Illness, ISBN, page 107:[] Signs are, first of all, physical things: for example, chalk marks on a blackboard, pencil or ink marks on paper, sound waves produced in a human throat. According to Reichenbach, \"What makes them signs is the intermediary position they occupy between an object and a sign user, i.e., a person.\" For a sign to be a sign, or to function as such, it is necessary that the person take account of the object it designates. Thus, anything in nature may or may not be a sign, depending on a person\\'s attitude toward it. A physical thing is a sign when it appears as a substitute for, or representation of, the object for which it stands with respect to the sign user. The three-place relation between sign, object, and sign user is called the sign relation or relation of denotation.(set theory) Specifically, a set of ordered pairs.Equality is a symmetric relation, while divisibility is not.(databases) A set of ordered tuples retrievable by a relational database; a table.This relation uses the customer\\'s social security number as a key.(mathematics) A statement of equality of two products of generators, used in the presentation of a group.(category theory) A subobject of a product of objects.(usually collocated: sexual relation) The act of intercourse.", "roemer": " (plural roemers)Alternative form of rummer1897,  Albert Hartshorne,  Old English Glasses: An Account of Glass Drinking Vessels in England, page 50:The delicate stringings, or wheeled quillings, also, round the necks of the roemers and berkemeyers are not less noteworthy than the stringings or spinningsnaturally never quilledof their bases or footings.1999,  Country Life, volume 193, page 118:Here the pipe and roemer glass obviously indicate taste and smell, and equally obviously, the transience of sensual pleasures.2016,  Ted Sandling,  London in Fragments: A Mudlark\\'s Treasures:When I first saw complete roemers (often pronounced \\'rummer\\', the name comes from the Dutch for making a toast, roemen) in the auction house where I was working, I knew their appeal went far beyond dedicated collectors.", "remord": " (third-person singular simple present remords, present participle remording, simple past and past participle remorded)(obsolete, intransitive) To feel remorse.(Can we find and add a quotation of Sir T.

At Aleppo, and its port Scanderoon, the cantaro contains 100 rottoli, each of which is subdivided into 12 ounces, or 720 drachms; the great cantaro of Tripoli contains 175 rottoli, and the zurlo consists of 27 rottoli. This rottolo, with which most sorts of goods are weighed, weighs 5 lbs. avoirdupois nearly. The rottolo with which the silks from Tripoli, and other parts of Syria, are weighed, consists of 700 drachms, answering to 4 avoirdupois. The rottolo used in weighing the Persian silks contains 680 drachms, or nearly 4 lbs. avoirdupois. The rottolo of Damascus, with which brass, camphor, benzoin, spikenard, balsam of Mecca, and other drugs are weighed, contains 600 drachms, or 415 lbs. avoirdupois. Five rottoli, or 3600 drachms, make what is called a vesno... At Saide, in Syria, (the ancient Sidon,) silk and sattin yarn are weighed with the rottolo of Damascus, of 600 drachms; 100 such rottoli answering to about 410 lbs. avoirdupois.

At Leghorn, the rottolo is 3 lbs. At Naples, the cantaro grosso contains 100 rottoli, each weighing 33 ounces of the gold and silver weight, or 3137 ounces avoirdupois. Hence 28 rottoli = 55 lbs. avoirdupois, and the cantaro grosso = 196 lbs. avoirdupois. The cantaro picolo is = 106 lbs. avoirdupois nearly. In Sicily these different weights are used, viz. the rottolo grosso of 33 ounces, the rottolo sotile of 30 ounces, and the libra, or pound of 12 ounces. 10 lbs. of Sicily = 7 lbs. avoirdupois nearly; and, therefore, 40 rottoli grossi, or 44 rottoli sotile = 77 lbs. avoirdupois. A cantaro grosso contains 100 rottoli grossi, or 192 lbs. avoirdupois; a cantaro sotile is 100 rottoli sottili, and is = 175 lbs. avoirdupois. At Smyrna, the cantaro, or kintal, contains 45 okes, or 100 rottoli. The batman is 6 okes, or 2400 drachms; and the oke is 400 drachms, and the rottolo = 180 drachms. The cantaro of 45 okes weighs 123 lbs. 4 oz. avoirdupois; and, therefore, the oke is = 2 lbs. 11 oz. 13 drs. avoirdupois. At Tripoli, the cantaro weight contains 100 rottoli, each of 6 ounces, or 128 termini; this cantaro answers to 168 lbs. peso sotile of Venice, or about 12 lbs. avoirdupois.
