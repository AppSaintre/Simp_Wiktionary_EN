For him the word suggests a kind of flexibility that can initiate effective, efficient, and energetic action based on a courageous assertion of the will and an ability to execute the products of one\\'s own calculations. Such calculations are a significant adjunct to his ideas about virt: they outline what might be called an internal or mental virt.1996,  Harvey C[laflin] Mansfield[, Jr.],  Machiavelli\\'s Virtue, Chicago, Ill.: University of Chicago Press, ISBN, pages 67:What is one to make of this? Machiavelli seems to deplore the need for a prince to be evil, and in the next breath to relish the fact. He alternately shocks his readers and provides relief from the very shocks he administers: Agathocles has virt but cannot be said to have virt. It is not enough to say that he uses the word in several senses; he uses it in two contradictory senses as to whether it includes or excludes evil deeds.2000,  Jack Donnelly,  Realism and International Relations, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN, page 175:Honor and glory are for [Niccol] Machiavelli closely tied to virt, \"virtue.\" The Latin virtus, from which the Tuscan/Italian term is derived, has its root in vir, man. Virt refers to those things especially characteristic of man, the qualities that make us human. To oversimplify, Machiavelli uses virt to refer both to Christian moral virtues, the conventional universalistic values embodied in the Golden Rule, and to a set of more particularistic classical virtues centered on honor. Together they comprise Machiavelli\\'s account of the most noble and distinctive human excellences, achievements, and aspirations.(art) Knowledge of the fine arts.1750,  Henry Fielding,  The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling.

Lowest in the hierarchy was the rabuni or \"master,\" a term borrowed from the Hebrew; somehow more accomplished was the rabunapet or \"headmaster\"; and still more distinguished was the vardapet, literally \"head teacher.\" [] It is clear that there was a certain formality involved in the training and promotion of a person to the rank of vardapet. Mxitar Go lays down in his Law Book that a cleric could be admitted to the rank of vardapet only after he had satisfied a panel of two or three vardapets about the level of his learning, though his training might have been under just a single vardapet. The vardapet was regarded as having a special authority to teach.2008,  Christopher [Hatch] MacEvitt,  The Price of Unity: Ecumenical Negotiations and the End of Rough Tolerance, in  The Crusades and the Christian World of the East: Rough Tolerance (Middle Ages Series), Philadelphia, Pa.: University of Pennsylvania Press, ISBN, page 167:Nerses\\'s negotiations with the Byzantines were in part a show performed for the vardapets; the discussions were held at Hromgla, the patriarchal residence, not in Constantinople or some other neutral city."}
