Indeed, many of those who accept an ontology which includes properties vehemently deny the existence of even exemplified haecceities.1993,  Studia Leibnitiana, Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, OCLC 607201184, page 51:What is there in the nature of individual substance which accounts for its unity and activity? As has been argued, [Gottfried Wilhelm] Leibniz did not regard haecceity as able to play this role, but frequently mentioned substantial form as a principle both of unity and activity. This makes it impossible to identify substantial form with haecceity. The strongest remaining possibility seems to be a composition of substantial form and haecceity within the nature of substance.2005,  John Duns Scotus, Allan B. Wolter, editor, Early Oxford Lecture on Individuation, St. Bonaventure, N.Y.: Franciscan Institute, ISBN, page xii:Since haec is the Latin term for \"this,\" Scotus and his disciples came to refer to this positive additive that individuates an individual\\'s nature or distinctive qualities as that individual\\'s unique or proper \"haecceity\" (haecceitas). Haecceity or \"thisness\" has a twofold function: (1) it makes each individual unique and incapable of duplication, even by an omnipotent God; and (2) it differentiates it radically and ultimately from each and every other individual, whether it be of the same or a specially different type.2007,  Joel Kupperman,  Classic Asian Philosophy: A Guide to the Essential Texts, 2nd edition, New York, N.Y.: Oxford University Press, ISBN, page 11:The late-twentieth-century philosopher Roderick Chisholm, in his Person and Object, suggested such a view: that each of us has an inner self-nature, a \"haecceity,\" which is available to introspective experience. This suggestion (which Chisholm later appeared to drop) had the appeal of having it both ways, preserving individuality (everyone\\'s haecceity is different from everyone else\\'s) while insisting on changelessness.2008,  Mark Goulthorpe,  The Possibility of (an) Architecture&#160;: Collected Essays, Abingdon, Oxon.; New York, N.Y.: Routledge, ISBN, page 75:Being asked to present our work in terms of \\'technology\\' seems to somehow imply it as haecceity&#160; as a graspable essence or entity, a \\'this-ness\\'.2009,  Fred Evans,  The Multivoiced Body: Society and Communication in the Age of Diversity, New York, N.Y.: Columbia University Press, ISBN, page 39:[Gilles] Deleuze and [Flix] Guattari often refer to the Individuals composed from elements as haecceities. Haecceities can be characterized by linguistic phrases involving one or more of the following: an indefinite article, a proper name, or an infinitive verb, for example, \"the heat of the day\" (\"What heat!\") as opposed to an exact temperature; \"a long day\" (\"What a long day!\") as opposed to the day as a set number of hours; [] Depending on the relations of speed and slowness between the unformed elements that make them up, these haecceities have specific \"affects,\" that is, capacities to affect or be affected by other haecceities.2011,  James F[ranklin] Harris,  The Ascent of Man: A Philosophy of Human Nature, New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, ISBN, page 93:Following Charles Peirce, I argued that it is the particular haecceity (the thisness), the come-up-againstness, presented by the natural world provides human beings with a particular physical environment within which actions can be fitted to circumstances in certain ways in order to attempt to bring about certain desired results. Therein lies the most fundamental basis for will, choice, and rationality.2013,  Anne Sauvagnargues; Samantha Bankston, transl.,  Deleuze and Art, London; New York, N.Y.: Bloomsbury Academic, ISBN, page 43:This is because [Gilles] Deleuze uses the concept of haecceity in order to advise us to think about a mode of individuation that is \"very different\" from what we generally consider a form or a subject.

On some occasions, barley has known to be too much hummelled, at least for the use of maltsters; as, when the awn breaks off so close as to leave a small portion of the kernel naked, such grains do not malt kindly.1848,  Henry Colman,  European Agriculture.

[] It is a pity that one of the last minstrels, if only one of humble rank, did not fix unchangeably in verse the component parts of the national haggis, as some one has done the \"Eve\\'s pudding,\" and Sydney Smith did for his salad, and another did for mulled wine. We have a compound called haggis, without the preceding article, composed of meat, chopped anchovies, eggs, bread, sour wine, pepper and salt. But that does not seem to correspond with the remarks of an editor of Burns, who says the haggis was to Scotland what the plum pudding is to England, and it was the pride of her people that all the ingredients and even the bag it was boiled in were of native production.1999,  Gary Rhodes,  Home-made Haggis, in  New British Classics, London: BBC Worldwide, ISBN:Haggis has a faggot-like consistency that certainly isn\\'t short of flavour. I like to make individual portion haggises (traditional haggises are cooked in the sheep\\'s paunch or stomach).
