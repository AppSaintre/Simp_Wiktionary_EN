[] This is marked by much physical contact, stroking, hugging, lip smacking and sharing. The social interactions are more relaxed, as are the individual members of the group, and there is much focus on physical contact. This is in marked contrast to other more primitive primates, where the agonic mode dominates social behaviour.2007,  Warren D.

The agonichedonic distinction has two limitations which have led to its disuse in contemporary primatology. First, Chance and his collaborators have clung to the untenable generalization that monkey society is agonic and ape society hedonic. This oversimplifies the complexities of the social and emotional lives of both major kinds of primate species.2009,  Maria Elizabeth Grabe; Erik Page Bucy,  Facing the Electorate, in  Image Bite Politics: News and the Visual Framing of Elections (Series in Political Psychology), New York, N.Y.: Oxford University Press, ISBN, page 177:Depictions of agonic displays, on the other hand, increased from the opening phase of the campaign to the debate period and then droped off as Election Day approached.
