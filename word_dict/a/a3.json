White,  John Keats and the Loss of Romantic Innocence [Costerus, new series; vol. 107], Amsterdam; Atlanta, Ga.: Rodopi, ISBN, page 94:In the only monograph on the subject, John Cooper Mendenhall describes aureate terms as \"words designed to achieve sententiousness and sonorous ornamentation of style principally through their being new, rare, or uncommon, and approved by the critical opinion of their time.\" Since the time of Lydgate, who named these loan words and neologisms \"aureate terms\" to denote their linguistic gilding, Latin or Latinate words were considered the prime examples. However, readers who found aureate terms pretentious began to call them inkhorn and inkpot terms, both references to the receptacles scholars carried to hold ink.2002,  Simon Horobin; Jeremy J.

Perhaps the best-known practitioner of aureate diction in the late ME period was the poet John Lydgate (c. 13701449/1450), monk of Bury St Edmunds, court poet and self-styled disciple of Chaucer. Something of the flavour of Lydgate\\'s aureate verse may be captured in the following extract from his A Balade in Commendation of Our Lady (a poem, incidentally, where Lydgate calls for aid from the auriat lycour of the muse Clio&#160; Lydgate seems to have been the first English writer to use the term \\'aureate\\').2015,  Northrop Frye, Robert D.

This sequence can be non-locally finite. Also \"arborescent\" does not imply \"collapsible\" (R2 for instance is arborescent). We will say that a 2-dimensional simplicial context X is almost arborescent if it can be obtained by a series of Whitehead dilations and of additions of 2-cells along their boundaries, starting from a point.(philosophy) Marked by insistence on totalizing principles, binarism and dualism (as opposed to the rhizome theory).Gilles Deleuze criticizes the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages, which he considers a perfect example of arborescent dualistic theory.2000,  Carl Olson,  Zen and the Art of Postmodern Philosophy: Two Paths of Liberation from the Representational Mode of Thinking, Albany, N.Y.: State University of New York Press, ISBN, page 193:Deleuze and Guattari think, for instance, that metaphysics is an example of arborescent thinking, which is a model of thought like an erect tree, because it has been shaped by arboreal metaphors from the moment of its origin. They explain, \"Arborescent systems are hierarchical systems with centers of significance (sic) and subjectification, central automata like organized memories. In the corresponding models, an element only receives information from a higher unit, and only receives a subjective affection along preestablished paths.\"2012,  Karen R. Foster; Dale C.

It is, in plain, a tree-like representation of the world, which gathers concepts and images that encourage our minds to think of the world in terms of trees and their component parts. [] Deleuze and Guattari draw attention to the arborescent schemas in philosophy and other areas and show how these foundational ideas are rarely challenged, even though they limit the manoeuvrability of thought and violently organize all subsequent lines of inquiry. [] The problem with arborescent thinking is that thoughts must begin from the trunk, and refer back to it; they cannot pop up elsewhere.2012,  B[radley] H[udson] McLean,  Biblical Interpretation and Philosophical Hermeneutics, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN, page 268:Ren Descartes once likened the structure of philosophy to a tree: [] Building on Descartes\\' insight, Gilles Deleuze and Flix Guattari have argued that Western humanist tradition in general is modeled on a treelike structure, or what they term an \"arborescent\" structure. A tree organizes its parts according to a principle that arises out of its own interiority and self-sufficiency: it germinates from a solitary seed or acorn and shoots forth what will become its trunk. Its whole canopy of branches above is integrated downwards into this trunk, and all of its roots below are similarly integrated upward into the same trunk. Considered as a model of Western knowledge, the trunk of this arborescent structure represents human rationality. Rationality is the highest value in an arborescent structure because it is rationality that organizes and integrates all forms of knowledge into a unified, coherent system, [] ", "awrong": " (comparative more awrong, superlative most awrong)(obsolete) Wrongly.", "arclength": " (plural arclengths)(geometry) The length of an arc", "asepticism": " (uncountable)(dated) freedom from sepsis; asepsis", "argand": " (uncountable)Synonym of Argand lamp1867,  Andrew Ure,  Ures Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures and Mines:The argand consists of a hollow annulus, from the upper surface of which the gas issues through a number of small apertures [] ", "aristolochiaceous": " (not comparable)(botany) Of or relating to the Aristolochiaceae.", "austringer": " (plural austringers)(obsolete) A keeper of goshawks.(falconry) A falconer who uses accipiters for hunting.", "ardassine": " (uncountable)(archaic) A kind of fine Persian silk.Her cymar was of ardassine, / Fire red from throat to hem  Helen Hay Whitney.", "areolar": " (comparative more areolar, superlative most areolar)(anatomy) Of or relating to areolae(botany) Of or relating to areoles.", "averagely": " (comparative more averagely, superlative most averagely)In an average mannerWith regard to an average", "azomethine": " (plural azomethines)(chemistry) any of a class of organic compounds of general formula RN=CR\\'2, especially the parent compound in which R\\' is H", "authorly": " (comparative more authorly, superlative most authorly)In the manner of an author.", "appraiser": " (plural appraisers)One who performs appraisals.", "apophlegmatic": " (not comparable)(medicine) Designed to facilitate discharges of phlegm or mucus from the mouth or nostrils.
