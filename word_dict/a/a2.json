They are frequently given as exemplars of a bird behavior known as \"anting,\" in which the bird lies down on an anthill with wings and tail spread and entices ants to swarm over it. Anting birds often grasp an ant in their beak, crush it, and wipe it under their wings, and over and through their feathers, and then sometimes eat them. [] The purpose of anting is still debated. It has been hypothesized that the formic acid in ants, when applied to the feathers, helps to control feather lice and other parasites, but the experimental evidence about this is mixed. It has also been suggested that birds are simply wiping the acid off so that the ants will taste better when they subsequently eat them. Others have suggested that anting is pleasurable, like a kind of bird catnip.2013,  Olin Sewall Pettingill, Jr.,  Ornithology in Laboratory and Field, 4th edition, Orlando, Fla.: Academic Press, ISBN, page 251:Anting. A behavior in which the fluids from ants, notably formic acid, are applied to the plumage and possibly the skin. There are two basic types of the behavior: active anting, in which the bird anoints its plumage with the bill, and passive anting, in which the bird allows ants to invade and anoint the plumage. [] Some individuals of these species, in unnatural situations such as in captivity, perform active anting with burning matches and cigarette smoke, moth balls, hair tonic, mustard, citrus fruits, numerous insects other than ants, and other substitutes.

In the case of germanium and silicon, the isolated disordered regions anneal at moderate temperatures of approximately 200 and 300 C, respectively. The amorphous layers also anneal in a characteristic fashion, but at appreciably higher temperatures, i.e., at approximately 600 C in silicon and 400 C in germanium. It should be noted that even though both types of disorder can be annealed at temperatures well below those where diffusion of the dopant species occurs, there are still defects present.1979,  J.G.

That such power of variation, such aptitude for transformation exists in these essential but metamorphic Fish, suggests the probability that some of the very earliest of the Amphibia, filial perhaps to forms far lower than the Lamprey, did not stop at the last metamorphic stage of an Anuran, but changed still further, and thus laid the foundation of the higher classes.2001,  George R.
