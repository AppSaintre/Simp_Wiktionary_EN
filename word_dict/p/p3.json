Water entering these surficial holes was believed to impact on the bedrock beneath creating a large pothole. The \"Moulin Hypothesis\", first suggested in 1874, continued to be accepted by many authors until the 1950s. However, commencing in the 1930s, other authors have suggested dissatisfaction with the moulin hypothesis, largely on the grounds that it failed to explain how ice could remain stable long enough for the \"giant\" potholes to form and why many potholes (like those at Rockwood) were present in large numbers.

One way is to investigate whether asset prices over the past few days or weeks can be used to predict tomorrows price. The answer is no. Following a large amount of careful statistical work by Fama in the 1960s, researchers now agree that past prices are of very little use in predicting returns over the immediate future. [...] An implication of the excessive swings in stock prices is that a high ratio of price relative to dividends in one year will tend to be followed by a fall in prices relative to dividends over subsequent years, and vice versa. This means that returns follow a predictable pattern in the longer run.
