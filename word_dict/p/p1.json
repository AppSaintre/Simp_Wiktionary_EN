Gyldns new approach was to adopt an orbit different from a Keplerian ellipse as his first approximation. Such an orbit is called an intermediary orbit (Gyldn, 1881, 1882). He studied the intermediary orbits of a comet (1877, 1884) and of the moon (1885). Gyldn amalgamated, in the intermediary orbit, the secular and the long-period terms in the perturbation of the Keplerian motion and called such an orbit an absolute orbit. He expressed the motion in such an intermediary orbit in a purely trigonometrical series which he mistakenly thought to be convergent. The deviations from such an intermediary orbit turned out to be purely periodic fluctuations. However, even for the intermediary orbit, the solution was very complicated. He made use of elliptic functions. His works are summarized in two volumes published in 1893 and 1909. A space curve contained between two concentric spheres and with its concave side facing always toward the common center of the two spheres is said to be periplegmatic. The radius vector of a periplegmatic curve is of length between the radii of the two spheres. At the maxima and minima of the radius vector the curve touches respectively the larger or smaller of the two limiting spheres. The radial distance between such a maximum and minimum is called the diastem.
