We also decree that if a vassal lies with the wife of his lord, or with his daughter or granddaughter, he shall lose his fief; and the same rule applies when he endeavors, in any way, to persuade them to receive him, or to abduct any of them for the purpose of bringing such dishonor upon his lord. By reason of all the offenses aforesaid, and of each of those we enumerated in the preceding law by which a vassal loses his fief when he commits them, a lord also loses the ownership of a fief, if he commits any of said offenses against the person of his vassal, or of his wife, children, grandchildren, or daughters-in-law, and the ownership of the fief will remain in the vassal forever, by the right of perpetual property.2010,  Gerard J.

This could be a scepter, ring, glove, and so on, but the lord always retained the object employed. At times an item was actually handed over to the vassal, but this was a cornstalk, a piece of turf, a banner, or something that clearly symbolized the fief itself. The renunciation of a fief was enacted by a similar ceremony. The vassal divested himself of the fief by placing his hands between those of his lord.
