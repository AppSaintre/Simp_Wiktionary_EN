It is the purest known form of animal jelly, and is obtained from the swimming bladder of a few kinds of fish, chiefly of the genus Sturgeon, the Acipenser of zoologists. This is indicated by some of its continental names, of which the English is no doubt a corruption;thus, in German, Isinglass is called Hausenblase, from hausen the great sturgeon, and blase a bladder.1858,  Catalogue of the Collection of Animal Products Belonging to Her Majesty\\'s Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851, Exhibited in the South Kensington Museum, London: Printed for Her Majesty\\'s Commissioners by W.

When of good quality isinglass is of a whitish colour, thin, and semi-transparent, but tough and flexible, destitute of taste as well as of smell. The inferior kinds are thicker, yellowish-coloured, opaque, and sometimes have a fishy smell and taste. In boiling water isinglass is entirely dissolved, with the exception of a very minute portion of impurities.1868,  Jonathan Pereira,  The Gelatinous Alimentary Principle, in Charles A.

[] Sometimes the bag is dried unopened, as in the case of the purse, pipe, and lump isinglasses of the shops. At other times it is laid open, and submitted to some preparation; being either dried unfolded, as in the leaf and honeycomb isinglasses; or folded, as in the staple (long and short) and book isinglasses; or rolled out, as in the ribbon isinglass.1991,  Tim E.

This was isinglass, a gelatinous substance that was derived from the inner membrane of the air bladder (also called the swimbladder, or sound). Isinglass had a variety of uses. The Ojibway valued it as an effective binding agent in the manufacture of paint. Isinglass was also a product much in demand in Europe during the fur trade period. It was noted as producing a high quality glue and as a fining agent for beers and wines.1994, William A. Hardwick, editor, Handbook of Brewing (Food Science and Technology; 64), New York, N.Y.: Marcel Dekker, Inc., ISBN, page 222:Not all fish have swim bladders, and those from certain tropical or semitropical areas (roughly 20 N and 15 S) provide the best quality isinglass for fining purposes. Of these fish, the threadfin family (Polynemoidia) provide excellent quality. In order to gain a desirable fining quality for a particular beer type, two or more kinds of isinglass may be blended. To illustrate this more precisely, Polynemus isinglass provides a fining that settles densely, whereas Silurus isinglass, from the great catfish family (Siluridae) in South America, gives a more flocculant fining but which settles less densely and consequently is more easily disturbed.A thin, transparent sheet of mica (probably from its similarity to true isinglass).1771,  J[ohn] Hill,  Fossils Arranged According to their Obvious Characters; with their History and Description; under the Articles of Form, Hardness, Weight, Surface, Colour, and Qualities; the Place of their Production, their Uses, and Distinctive English, and Classical Latin Names, London: Printed for R.

From independent word-order restrictions (an NP Complement must be positioned immediately adjacent to its sister V), it will follow that an NP Complement must precede the clausal Complement. Given that both Exceptional Clauses and Small Clauses must immediately follow a transitive Verb, it will follow that the clausal Complement of persuade cannot be an S or an SC, but rather must be an S-bar.

When Caesar added ten days to the Roman year he put them near the ends of the seven 29-day months, one or two in each. As a result, instead of the day after the Ides of all months being a.d.
