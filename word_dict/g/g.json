At the same time that he suggested \"googol\" he gave a name for a still larger number: \"Googolplex.\" A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired. This is a description of what would happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have [Primo] Carnera a better mathematician than Dr. [Albert] Einstein, simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex then, is a specific finite number, with so many zeros after the 1 that the number of zeros is a googol. A googolplex is much bigger than a googol, much bigger than a googol times a googol. A googol times a googol would be 1 with 200 zeros, whereas a googolplex is one with a googol of zeros. You will get some idea of the size of this very large but finite number from the fact that there would not be enough room to write it, if you went to the farthest star, touring all the nebulae and putting down zeros every inch of the way.1952, John Wood Campbell Jr., editor, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, New York, N.Y.: Cond Nast Publications, OCLC 174072257, page 164:Consider that we can start with one googolplex and count: two googolplexes, three googolplexes and so on up to a googolplex googolplexes and beyondand still not have reached infinity.1980,  Carl Sagan,  chapter IX, in  Cosmos, New York, N.Y.: Random House, ISBN:If the universe were packed solid with neutrons, say, so there was no empty space anywhere, there would still only be about 10128 particles in it, quite a bit more than a googol but trivially small compared to a googolplex.2015,  K. G. Johansson,  Googolplex, [Sweden?]: Affront, ISBN:The theoretical number of nucleic acids in DNA, Jack had heard centuries ago, was ten to the power of one hundred and twenty thousand. He couldn\\'t even imagine a number that would hold the set of possible universes, meaning every possible state and position for every particle in every Planck time. Googolplex, he thought, 1 followed by a googol of zeroes: googolplex raised to the power of googolplex.(figuratively) An unimaginably large number.2010,  Don N[elson] Page,  Our Place in the Vast Universe, in Melville Y. Stewart, editor, Science and Religion in Dialogue, volume I, Malden, Mass.: Wiley-Blackwell, ISBN, page 371:Inflationary theory suggests that the entirety of space is vastly larger. Quantum theory suggests that there are many different copies of space of the same basic kind as ours (same laws of physics). String theory further suggests that there may be many different kinds of space. This whole collection of googolplexes of galaxies within each of googolplexes of different spaces within each of googols of kinds of space makes up an enormously vast universe or multiverse.2014,  John [Herbert] Varley,  Dark Lightning, New York, N.Y.: Ace Books, ISBN:In some unimaginable future, the universe will stretch so thin that the light from one galaxy would be unable to reach any other galaxy. Eventually, all the stars would burn out, and the universe would consist of the dead cinders of stars, black holes, and uncountable googolplexes of cubic light-years of cold, empty space.(US, real estate, nonstandard, rare) An infinitesimally small portion of land, defined for legal purposes.1962,  Newsweek: The International Newsmagazine, volume 60, New York, N.Y.: Newsweek LLC, ISSN 0028-9604, OCLC 609642093, page 54:To a mathematician, a googolplex is the figure 1 followed by a googol of zeroes (a googol being the figure 1 followed by a mere 100 zeroes).

[] As with the more familiar lizards, geckoes have the ability to cast the tail, and counts show that in some species two out of every five individuals have cast the tail and regenerated a new one.1971,  Victorian Year Book, Melbourne, Vic.: Government Printer, OCLC 267073805, page 23:Family Gekkonidae (gekkos). In gekkos the skull is short and flat; the upper temporal bone arch is missing; the post-orbital and lacrimal bones are absent; and the jugal bone is very reduced.1975 September 27,  Colin Tudge,  How Gekko gecko defies gravity: A careful anatomical study of geckoes, those extremely agile climbing lizards, reveals an extraordinary degree of adaptation of the foot bones and muscles, in  New Scientist, volume 67, number 968, London: New Science Publications, OCLC 761620626, page 696:Many lizards, including the British common and sand lizards of the family Lacertidae, clamber over rocks with great agility; none matches the geckoes, some of which can run up, down, or across vertical glass as easily as most beasts run on the flat, and indeed can happily traverse ceilings.1988,  Uttar Pradesh District Gazetteers: Aligarh, volume 20, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India: Government of Uttar Pradesh, OCLC 7625267, page 15:Other reptiles found in the district are the chamaeleon, geco and monitor lizard, the last getting extinct due to netting and shooting.

However, Aristotle was not able to see the tiny hairs, called setae, that cover the toes of geckos and empower this feat. The setae are part of an adhesive system that allows geckos to maneuver on a wide variety of substrates, to run upside-down, and to arrest their falls. Geckos can run vertically at over 1 m/s and can carry over twice their body weight up smooth, vertical surfaces.2014,  Wil Mara,  From Gecko Feet to Adhesive Tape (Innovations from Nature), Ann Arbor, Mich.: Cherry Lake Publishing, ISBN, pages 2122:The potential uses for gecko-inspired adhesive products are nearly endless.

As the place grew overcrowded, the content was carried to the cemetery for burial.2002,  Stephen M. Brown,  Beginning Talmud Torah, in Stephen Garfinkel and Karen L. Stein, editors, Reclaiming Our Legacy: The More Torah, the More Life, revised edition, New York, N.Y.: Department of Youth Activities, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, OCLC 18557606, pages 110111:[A]ccording to Jewish law and practice, ritual objects which contained the name of God could not be thrown away or destroyed. The tradition was to treat these objects with great reverence. A place called a Genizah (from Persian, \"ganoz,\" which means \"treasury\" or \"hidden place\") was created to house these ritual objects. [] A genizah, therefore, was a place of concealment. Sometimes this was a hidden cave; other times it was space between the stories of a building or a separate cupboard or small room with a small opening into which could be placed the remnants of books and manuscripts which contained the name of God. [] Often things placed in the genizah were destroyed over the years from mildew and erosion, but in certain climates they were preserved. Such was the case with a great genizah in old Cairo that was discovered by Professor Solomon Schechter. Schechter\\'s discovery opened to modern Jewish scholarship thousands of pages of ancient manuscripts and original works that had been lost or not known to modern scholars.2016,  Mark Glickman,  Loading the Jewish Bookshelf, in  Stolen Words: The Nazi Plunder of Jewish Books, Philadelphia, Pa.: Published by the University of Nebraska Press as a Jewish Publication Society book, ISBN, page 33:Originally Jewish law required only the words of Scripture to be stashed in genizahs, but over time the understanding of which texts were sacred often became far broader. Soon Jews were depositing rabbinic writings as well as scriptural ones into their genizahs. Later, they included any document even mentioning God and sometimes documents bearing any Hebrew at all. In fact, by the tenth centuryparticularly in the highly literate lands of the Middle East and North Africamany Jews seem to have considered any document of any kind worthy of preservation in their genizah repositories.", "girlhoods": "plural of girlhood", "groaning": " (not comparable)That groans.(figuratively) Heavily laden, as if to creak under the strain.
