There were causes at work which were leading to the establishment of superiorities and suzerainties of one township over another. There were causes at work which tended to place the benefits of an unequal proprietary system and the enjoyment of these suzerainties in the hands of particular families, and consequently of their chiefs for the time being.19201921,  L[assa Francis Lawrence] Oppenheim, Ronald F. Roxburgh, editor, International Law: A Treatise, volume I (Peace), 3rd edition, London; New York, N.Y.: Longman, Green and Co., page 162:Suzerainty is a term which was originally used for the relation between the feudal lord and his vassal; the lord was said to be the suzerain of the vassal, and at that time suzerainty was a term of Constitutional Law only. With the disappearance of the feudal system, suzerainty of this kind likewise disappeared. Modern suzerainty involves only a few rights of the suzerain State over the vassal State which can be called constitutional rights. The rights of the suzerain State over the vassal are principally international rights, of whatever they may consist.1985,  Edward N[icolae] Luttwak,  Strategy and History: Collected Essays, volume 2, New Brunswick, N.J.; Oxford: Transaction Publishers, ISBN, page 116:Given this background, it is highly inaccurate to portray the Soviet presence in the Middle East as having \"replaced\" former Western suzerainties. The two phenomena are very different: the Western suzerainties had the fixed political meaning of subjection; the Soviet presence does not.

[] The closer the apical meristem is to the roots of the plant, the more juvenile it is likely to be. This feature is exploited by techniques such as hedging or stool bedding that employ severe pruning to decrease the distance between the new growth and the root system, thus acting to rejuvenate the plant and benefit from the ease of rooting that is characteristic of the juvenile phase.2012, Michael Allaby, editor, A Dictionary of Plant Sciences, 3rd edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, ISBN, pages 125 and 486:A coppice may be large, in which case trees, usually ash (Fraxinus) or maple (Acer) are cut, leaving a massive stool from which up to 10 trunks arise; or small, in which case trees, usually hazel (Corylus), hawthorn (Crataegus), or willow (Salix), are cut to leave small, underground stools producing many short stems. [] One consequence of coppicing is that the stool enlarges because each subsequent growth of shoots occurs on its outside. The diameter of a stool is thus directly related to its age. [] stool 1.

The mature or normal super-ego, on the other hand, is flexible; it can evaluate the situationat hand and modify the rules accordingly. Thus, in an early,classic paper, Strachey suggested that the basic aim of psycho-analytic treatment is to make such \"mutative interpretations\"as would help to render the patient\\'s \"rigid superego\" more\"flexible\".8 Like the psychoanalytic theory of the superego, onwhich it is based, this view suffers from the limitation of beingsilent on what sort of rigidity is considered bad or undesirableand what sort of flexibility is considered good or desirable.

In A v. UK, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights held that Part 4 of the 2001 Act was not a strictly necessary response to the acknowledged emergency evidenced by the attacks in the USA and that the detention of the applicants was in breach of Article 5.
