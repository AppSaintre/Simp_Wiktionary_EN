[] [page 3] This term is modeled on the shortened formgosizdatof State Publishing House (Gosudarstvennoe Izdatel\\'stvo). [] According to Julius Telesin, a Russian writer who emigrated to Israel in 1970, the word samizdat occurs first in the late fifties when a Moscow poet, exasperated with the operation of the censorship system, bound together the typewritten sheets of his poems and wrote Samsebiaizdate (\"Publishing House for Oneself\") in the place where the name of the publishing house would normally appear. He also used the term samizdat with the same meaning but, as Telesin observes, samizdat (\"self-publishing house\") subsequently acquired a wider meaning.1992,  Igor Hajek,  Samizdat Literature: An Introduction, in Marketa Goetz-Stankiewicz, editor, Good-bye, Samizdat: Twenty Years of Czechoslovak Underground Writing, Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, ISBN, page 4:From a clandestine network of friends passing to each other typed copies of their new work, the initiative developed over the years into a parallel publishing system. [] [I]n cities the inquisitive reader did not have much difficulty in obtaining access to what was in fact a banned literature. Samizdat was also an important source of new writing for the equally active and enterprising publishers of Czech (and some Slovak) books in exile.2015,  James P. Scanlan,  From Samizdat to Perestroika: The Soviet Marxist Critique of Soviet Society, in Raymond C. Taras, editor, The Road to Disillusion: From Critical Marxism to Post-communism in Eastern Europe, London: Routledge, ISBN:Indeed, internal criticism of the USSR from a Marxist perspective has been a continuing fact of Soviet life for decades.

The money acquired through sales is used for&#160; and this the consumer is well aware of&#160; the advancement of the Solidarity movement.2009,  W[illiam] R. Clement,  Culture in Hyperspace: This is Not a Computer Game, in  Quantum Jump: A Survival Guide for the New Renaissance, Toronto: Insomniac Press, ISBN, page 257:Samizdats were unauthorized books reproduced with a typewriter and as many as seven carbon copies. They were the product of the country\\'s artistic elite and were critical of the government. Possession of, writing, or typing a samizdat could and occasionally did result in arrest and the perpetrator being sentenced to a gulag. This was mostly an illusion. The writers and distributors of samizdats were seldom at risk after the death of Stalin.2013,  Friederike Kind-Kovcs; Jessie Labov,  Introduction: Samizdat and Tamizdat, in Friederike Kind-Kovcs and Jessie Labov, editors, Samizdat, Tamizdat, and Beyond: Transnational Media during and after Socialism (Studies in Contemporary European History; 13), New York, N.Y.: Berghahn Books, ISBN, page 3:The fact that samizdat/tamizdat were written symbols of the human suffering in the Eastern bloc encouraged a less critical and often naive reading of the texts both then and now.

Nevertheless I have often observed a sensible scintillation of Venus and Mars, and in a few rare cases I have also observed a slight scintillation of Jupiter and Saturn. [] I would therefore call the attention of observers who may find themselves under atmospherical conditions of a nature to render the general scintillation very strong, to this point, as they might perhaps be able to ascertain whether Jupiter and Saturn ever sensibly scintillate.2007,  Judith A[nn] Irwin,  Measuring the Signal, in  Astrophysics: Decoding the Cosmos, Chichester, West Sussex: John Wiley &amp; Sons, ISBN, page 48:A star, or other point-like source, viewed through the atmosphere can be seen by eye to fluctuate in intensity. An extended object has a brightness distribution that is convolved with the seeing disk. That is, the object\\'s brightness distribution can be thought of as a series of point sources of different brightness, each one \\'blurred\\' to the size of the seeing disk and each seeing disk is scintillating. If the eye could spatially resolve each of these points, it would see brightness fluctuations across a source. However, the resolution of the human eye ( 1) is much poorer than the seeing ( 1).

In Ps. xlix there are two Selahs (vs. 13, 15,) indicating the refrain, \"Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:\" and, also, a repetition, (with some variation,) of the following words, \"Nevertheless man being in honor abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.\" Vs. 12, 20.1968,  Rembert Sorg,  Habaqquq III and Selah, Fifield, Wis.: King of Martyrs Priory, OCLC 18128, page 33:Students of Selah have been puzzled because in the psalms, which Mishna ascribes to each day of the week for the daily sacrifice, the desired number of Selahs is not to be found. The answer is that the peraqim were timed to the ritual at the altar and that, even though the term Selah might not occur at all in some of these psalms, the peraqim and prostrations referred to the actual Selah ceremony.
