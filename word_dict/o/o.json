For example, occultations by the Uranian rings can define the position of the occulted star relative to the rings to better than 0.02 mas (equivalent to a few hundred meters at the distance of Uranus). Occultations by atmospheres can be less precise than occultations by symmerical solid bodies, like rings and large asteroids, with a precision on the order of 1.0 mas.2010,  David H.

From the latter point of view, the obscene consumer is one who either consumes too little or who consumes what are, from the prespective of consumer society, the \\'wrong\\' things (heroin, guns). (I propose the concept of the \\'dangerous consumer\\' here since it is clear that such consumers can pose a danger to contemporary society.) From a postmodern perspective, the obscene consumer is one who consumes in a highly visible manner. Such a consumer comes very close to Veblen\\'s conspicuous consumer. While an argument can be made that some consumers are obscene from a postmodern point of view, the obscenities associated with McDonaldized systems, credit cards, the new means of consumption and so on are far more important than those associated with the consumer.2009,  Ingrid Loschek,  When Clothes Become Fashion: Design and Innovation Systems, ISBN:However, the new is not radical or provocative or obscene a priori.
