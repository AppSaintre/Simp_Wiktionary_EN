Veterinary Surgeons were examined who said that the habit of Crib-biting was injurious to Horses; that the air sucked into the stomach of the animal distended it, and impaired its powers of digestion, occasionally to such an extent as greatly to diminish the value of the horse and render it incapable of work.1892,  [Frederick Tynte] Warburton,  Accidents and Diseases, in  The Race Horse: How to Buy, Train, and Run Him, London: Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Company Limited, St. Dunstan\\'s House, Fetter Lane, Fleet Street, E.C., OCLC 228740544, page 261:Cribbing is scarcely a disease, though it may be productive of disease of the larynx. It is a habit usually acquired by young horses, either in idle moments or by imitation, often from the dam. The colt takes any wooden substance, such as a paling or manger, between his teeth and gnaws it. From that he proceeds to inhale the air, and often, when this habit has been acquired, he becomes a windsucker. It is probable that windsucking produces irritation in the throat and air-passages, and may lead to some enlargement, and consequently to roaring; but it is more probable that windsucking is the effect of disease.2004,  Paul McGreevy,  Equine Behavior: A Guide for Veterinarians and Equine Scientists, Edinburgh; Philadelphia, Pa.: W[alter] B[urns] Saunders, ISBN, page 202, column 1:A crib-biting horse repeatedly seizes fixed objects with its incisor teeth and pulls back while making a characteristic grunting noise that signifies the passage of air into the esophagus.
