One of the most useful methodsfor resolving this dilemma is our capacity for abstractionwhich makes it possible to construct progressively higherlevels of symbolization; these constructs, in turn, lead to alessening of the feeling of compulsion attached to rules explic-itly understood as rules. Thus, for each set of rules we can, inprinciple, construct a set of metarules. The latter are made upof the specifications governing the formation of the rules at thenext lower (logical) level. Explicit awareness of metarulesimplies an understanding of the origin, function, and scope ofthe (next lower level) rules. Acquiring such understandingconstitutes a form of mastery. Only by practicing what may becalled the metarule attitudewhich is actually a special caseof the scientific attitude applied to the domain of rulescanwe acquire a secure yet flexible integration of rules as behav-ior-regulating agencies.

It neither rises nor falls with the rent of the land. It neither encourages nor discourages improvement. The tythe in the greater part of those parishes which pay what is called a modus, in lieu of all other tythe is a tax of this kind.
