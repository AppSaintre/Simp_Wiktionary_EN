As a consequence of premature decease, the \"Bardo,\" is prolongated. This is the middle state between the death and the new re-birth, which does not follow immediately, but there exists an interval, which is shorter for the good than for the bad. The prolongation of this intermediate state is considered as a punishment caused by evil spirits who have only power over sinful men.1996,  Victoria LePage,  The Perfection of the Shortest Path, in  Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth behind the Myth of Shangri-La, 1st Quest edition, Wheaton, Ill.: The Theosophical Publishing House, ISBN, page 95:The soul\\'s gradual progress to God in terms of a spiralling pathway up the side of the cosmic mountain, from one spiritual station to the next, is an image common to almost all of the world\\'s mystical systems; but few mention the direct path from the base of the mountain straight up to the summit. Even the Bardo Thodol mentions the direct path only once, and then glancingly, confining itself solely to a description of the soul\\'s circuitous afterlife journey through the heaven-worlds. The shortcut for heroes that bypasses the heaven-worlds or bardos and takes them straight to the divine worldin one lifetime, so it is saidis so well guarded in religious literature that the relevant Tibetan Buddhist texts are written in the \"twilight language,\" a cipher that can be understood only with the help of revelation.1998,  Susanne Paolo,  Prologue, in  Bardo (The Brittingham Prize in Poetry), Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, ISBN, page xiii:The bardo in Tibetan means an intermediate state, most specifically the one after death when your soul wanders through the heavens and hell, trying to avoid rebirth into samsarathe realm of the materialand achieve nirvana or Buddhahood.
