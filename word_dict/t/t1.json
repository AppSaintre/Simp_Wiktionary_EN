Often thought of as a snack taken with afternoon tea, tiffin is actually a light lunch eaten at midday. Indian colonial writings make numerous references to tiffin. [] Tiffin was not always the lightest of meals. In a 1904 account, Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, an American travel writer and photographer, described the overindulgent culinary order of the day in colonial Calcutta: \"The solid two-o\\'clock tiffin, following the heavy ten-o\\'clock breakfast, is so soon succeeded by the four-o\\'clock tea and the eight-o\\'clock dinner, that it is a surprise that any one survives the constant feasting which fills Anglo-Indian life.\"2013,  Sara Roncaglia,  Feeding the City: Work and Food Culture of the Mumbai Dabbawalas, Cambridge: Open Book Publishers, DOI:10.11647/OBP.0031, ISBN, page 22:Tiffin work started with Raghunath Medge\\'s father, who worked first of all at Bombay Churchgate station. When the British Raj was in power, then there was work at Churchgate. The people who worked at Girni had tiffin delivered to them. [] People went out early in the morning and tiffin was delivered later.(Britain, India) A container used to carry a tiffin; tiffin box, tiffin carrier, tiffin container.2011,  Mahtab Narsimhan,  The Tiffin, Toronto, Ont.: Dancing Cat Books, ISBN:\"Young memsahib, an empty tiffin box costs ten rupees in the market.

That last one\\'s for him, isn\\'t it?\" He jerked his chin at the tiffin Anahita was still hugging.
