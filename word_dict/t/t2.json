Some represent founders of the individual family, while others represent founders of the community, such as priests and kings. The spirits of founders of communities are called \"territorial\" or \"tutelary spirits\" in the literature for the region. Tutelary spirits cut across family lines because they belong to the community and are evoked on its behalf (generally only for rainmaking). They are associated with public proscriptions, and their propitiation is controlled by chiefs, kings, and priests.1992,  Peter Murphy,  Socialism and Democracy, in Peter Beilharz, Gillian Robinson, and John [F.] Rundell, editors, Between Totalitarianism and Postmodernity: A Thesis Eleven Reader, Cambridge, Mass.; London: MIT Press, ISBN, page 25:The tutelary state is a protective and regulatory state. As De Tocqueville argued, the independent persons of the democratic age, when they find themselves vulnerable, look outward for assistance. They can\\'t receive it from their equals, who are disinterested, so they look for it from the state. Yet the idea of equality forbids, absolutely, this state providing social guarantees in a politically despotic manner. That would re-introduce personal dependency in a new guise. Clientelism, patrimonialism, patronage would be returned. So a new kind of state is required. This is the administrative or tutelary state.

I submit, however, that the char-acteristic features of transference can be observed in othersituations as well, especially in the area of learned skills.6Thus, speaking a language with a foreign accent is one of themost striking everyday examples of transference. In the tradi-tional concept of transference, one person (the analysand)behaves toward another (the analyst) as if the latter weresomeone else, previously familiar to him; and the subject isusually unaware of the actual manifestations of his own trans-ferred behavior. In exactly the same way, persons who speakEnglish (or any other language) with a foreign accent treatEnglish as if it were their mother tongue; and they are usuallyunaware of the actual manifestations of their transferred be-havior. Such persons think of themselves as speaking unac-cented English: they cannot hear their own distortions of thelanguage when they speak. Only when their accent is pointedout to them, or, better, only when they hear their recordedvoices played back to them, do they recognize their linguistictransferences. These are striking parallels not only betweenthe stereotyped behavioral acts due to previous habit, but alsobetween the necessity for auxiliary channels of informationoutside the person\\'s own self for recognizing the effects ofthese habits.
